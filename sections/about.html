                founding members</p>

            <hr class="founders-divider">

            <div class="founders-message-body">
                <p>We invite you to explore our philosophy, and we genuinely appreciate the time you are taking to read our story.</p>
                <p>The fact that you're here, spending a few of your minutes with us, means more than any star count or
                    download metric ever could. So before anything else: <em>thank you.</em></p>

                <hr class="founders-divider">

                <h3>First, what Vanduo Framework is <em>not</em></h3>
                <p>Let's clear the air.</p>
                <p>Vanduo is <strong>not</strong> a competitor to Nuxt, Vue, or React. We are not here to replace your
                    favorite tools, start a framework war, or convince you to rewrite your perfectly working
                    application. Those projects are remarkable feats of engineering, maintained by brilliant people, and
                    they solve real problems at enormous scale. We respect them deeply.</p>
                <p>Vanduo does <strong>not</strong> operate on a Virtual DOM. There is no reconciliation algorithm
                    running behind the scenes, no diffing tree, no synthetic event system. And that's by design — not by
                    limitation.</p>

                <hr class="founders-divider">

                <h3>So what <em>is</em> Vanduo?</h3>
                <p><strong>Vanduo is the best friend of Dynamic Web, SPA, Lazy Loading, and Static Web alike.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Think of it this way: not every page on the internet needs a reactive state machine. Not every
                    portfolio, documentation site, or landing page needs to ship a JavaScript runtime to the browser
                    before a single word of text appears on screen. But those pages <em>do</em> deserve to appear
                    beautiful, feel responsive, and load instantly.</p>
                <p>That's where Vanduo lives.</p>
                <p>We built Vanduo for the projects that come <em>before</em> and <em>around</em> the complex ones — the
                    spaces where HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of vanilla JavaScript are not just enough, but are <em>the
                        right tool for the job.</em> Vanduo gives those projects a design system that would make any SPA
                    jealous, without asking you to install a single dependency.</p>

                <hr class="founders-divider">

                <h3>Why we built this</h3>
                <p>We started Vanduo because we noticed something: the web had become heavy. Not heavy in a bad-faith
                    way — heavy because, somewhere along the line, the simplest possible website began requiring a
                    <code>node_modules</code> folder, a bundler config, and a PhD in toolchain orchestration.
                </p>
                <p>We asked ourselves: <em>what if we went the other way?</em></p>
                <p>What if we stripped away everything that doesn't serve the developer or the end user? What if we
                    treated constraints — zero dependencies, no build step, no npm install — not as limitations, but as
                    a creative compass?</p>
                <p>The answer was water. Essential, transparent, adaptable. <em>Vanduo.</em></p>

                <hr class="founders-divider">

                <h3>Our hopes, dreams, and ambitions</h3>
                <p>We hope to keep Vanduo <strong>lean</strong>. Every kilobyte should earn its place. If something
                    doesn't serve you or your users, we want the courage to leave it out.</p>
                <p>We dream of keeping Vanduo <strong>honest</strong>. No magic, no black boxes. You can read every line
                    we ship — and we hope you will. Understanding your tools shouldn't require a decoder ring.</p>
                <p>We aspire to keep Vanduo <strong>open</strong> — not open as a marketing strategy, but open as a
                    principle. This is not a product with a free tier. This is a gift to the community, maintained with
                    care, documented with pride, and released under a license that means what it says.</p>
                <p>And above all, our deepest ambition is to keep Vanduo <strong>for you</strong>. Not for hype cycles,
                    not for benchmarks, not for conference talks — for the developer sitting at a desk at 2 AM who just
                    wants their site to look great without fighting a framework.</p>
                <p>We're not there yet on all of these. But having the right ambitions matters, and these are ours.</p>

                <hr class="founders-divider">

                <h3>For every kind of builder</h3>
                <p>The way people build for the web is changing — fast.</p>
                <p>There are <strong>vibe coders</strong> spinning up entire projects in an afternoon with AI at the
                    wheel. There are <strong>weekend builders</strong> turning side ideas into real products between
                    Saturday coffee and Sunday dinner. There are <strong>solo devs</strong> wearing every hat,
                    <strong>small teams</strong> punching above their weight, and <strong>hustlers</strong> who need
                    their landing page live <em>yesterday</em>.
                </p>
                <p>We see all of you. And we built Vanduo with all of you in mind.</p>
                <p>Our ambition is to make Vanduo <strong>AI-friendly while being developer-friendly first</strong> —
                    and we mean <em>every</em> kind of developer:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The <strong>full AI vibe coder</strong> who wants to describe a page and watch it materialize.
                    </li>
                    <li>The <strong>hybrid developer</strong> who pairs with AI but keeps their hands on the wheel.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>no-AI purist</strong> who wants to understand every single line and wouldn't have it
                        any other way.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Vanduo works for all three because there is nothing hidden. No abstraction layer to confuse a
                    language model. No magic syntax that only makes sense if you've read 400 pages of documentation.
                    Just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — the languages that both humans and AI already speak fluently.</p>
                <p>That's also why we've already started including <strong><code>llms.txt</code></strong> files in our
                    repository — structured, AI-readable summaries of the entire framework. It's a small step, but it's
                    a natural evolution of how we build the web. Because if the future of development is a conversation between human
                    creativity and machine capability, we want Vanduo to be a language they both understand.</p>

                <hr class="founders-divider">

                <h3>A small thing can matter</h3>
                <p>We don't need to be the biggest framework. We don't need to be on every trending list. If Vanduo
                    helps even one developer ship a project they're proud of — a project that loads in a blink, looks
                    polished on every device, and was <em>fun</em> to build — then everything we've poured into this was
                    worth it.</p>
                <p>Water doesn't compete with fire. It doesn't compete with earth. It just flows, adapts, and gives life
                    wherever it goes.</p>
                <p>That's the shape of the water. That's Vanduo.</p>
                <p><strong>We invite you to let your ideas flow just as freely. Join us, and let's build something lasting together.</strong></p>

                                <p>A web where lightweight sites are the norm, not the exception. Where choosing

                            <p>Zero dependencies. No build step. No npm install. Every kilobyte earns its place. Vanduo
                                ships as pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript -- if a feature can't justify its weight, it
                                doesn't get in. These limits aren't restrictions; they're the reason the framework stays
                                fast, portable, and honest.</p>

                                look polished without pulling in hundreds of packages.</p>

                        <p class="vd-mt-3">Just as water is essential for life, we believe a good CSS framework
                            should be essential yet unobtrusive -- flowing naturally into your projects without
                            forcing you to change your workflow. Water adapts to its container; Vanduo adapts to
                            your design.</p>
